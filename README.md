# Readme Generator

## Description
To facilitate the learning of how node works (and in addition, how inquirer works), I've decided to put together a basic readme generator. This should help in the future, though it may need a bit of tweaking down the road. Theoretically, this could fit into your workflow for finishing touches prior to getting the . Very simple, very basic.

## Installation
Clone or download a copy of this to your machine. You can start it by typing ```node index.js``` from the command line. From there, follow the prompts. Depending on your needs, this may require some tweaking after the generator is completed.

## Usage
The usage of this product could, again, fit into your workflow. Since this is from the command line, theoretically if you have a file that runs your workflow, it should be simple enough to combine.

For a demonstration of the present status of the product, please see the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XhMNqVZMb_oSLj968scPwo7V_ON19NlA/view)

Please note: This program calls whatever editor you have by default as part of your environment variable. If none is specified, for Windows it calls Notepad (as demonstrated) and for Mac/Linux, vim is used.

## Credits
This program heavily relies on inquirer. Documentation for this package can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) Please note that this is in more of a maintenance mode and that its successor is the prompts package.
